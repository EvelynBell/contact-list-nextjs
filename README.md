## Contact List

<<<<<<< HEAD
Simple contact list app made using React. New contacts can be added to the list by clicking the add contact button and filling out the given form.
Clicking on a contact on the main page opens up a larger page with their image and information; however, clicking edit does not yet allow you edit or delete contacts from the list.
